# set-up-preact

set-up-preact is a simple command line tool for setting up a Preact project created with [create-preact-app](https://npmjs.com/create-preact) so it's ready to go to code. Here's what it does:

- Removes unnecessary files
- Enables [`"strict": true`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) in Typescript
- Sets up:
  - [PNPM](https://pnpm.io)
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter)
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

## Usage

Install it with cargo:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/mybearworld/set-up-preact.git
```
